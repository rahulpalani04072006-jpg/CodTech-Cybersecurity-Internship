## Description
This task focuses on developing a Python-based web application vulnerability scanner.
The tool analyzes web pages and HTML forms to identify common security vulnerabilities
such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It works by submitting test
payloads and observing server responses to detect potential security weaknesses.
## Libraries Used
- requests
- BeautifulSoup

## Features
- Fetches web page content
- Scans forms and inputs
- Detects suspicious vulnerability patterns

## Outcome
Learned basic web security concepts and vulnerability scanning techniques.
