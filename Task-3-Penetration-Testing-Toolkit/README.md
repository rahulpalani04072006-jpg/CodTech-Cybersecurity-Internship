## Description
This task involves building a modular penetration testing toolkit using Python.
The toolkit demonstrates fundamental penetration testing techniques such as
port scanning to identify open network ports. The application is menu-driven
and follows ethical hacking practices by restricting usage to authorized systems.

## Modules Included
- Port Scanner (basic and safe)

## Concepts Used
- Networking
- Sockets
- Modular programming
- Ethical hacking principles

## Disclaimer
This toolkit is developed for educational purposes only.
It must be used only on authorized systems such as localhost.
