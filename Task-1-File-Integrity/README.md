## Description
This task focuses on developing a Python-based web application vulnerability scanner.
The tool analyzes web pages and HTML forms to identify common security vulnerabilities
such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It works by submitting test
payloads and observing server responses to detect potential security weaknesses.
## Concepts Used
- Hashing
- File handling
- SHA-256 algorithm

## Outcome
Learned how hash values ensure file integrity using Python.
