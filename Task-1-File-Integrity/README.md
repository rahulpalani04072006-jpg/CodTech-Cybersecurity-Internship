# Task 1: File Integrity Checker
NAME:RAHUL.P
INTERN ID :CTIS063
DOMAIN NAME:CYBERSECURITY AND ETHICAL HACKING
DURATION:28 DAYS
## Description
This task involves monitoring file integrity by calculating and comparing cryptographic
hash values. The tool helps detect unauthorized file modifications by generating a
secure hash of a file and verifying it after changes. Any mismatch in hash values
indicates that the file has been altered, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.
## Concepts Used
- Hashing
- File handling
- SHA-256 algorithm

## Outcome
Learned how hash values ensure file integrity using Python.
